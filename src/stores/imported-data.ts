\
When Morathi transforms, her High Oracle of Khaine model is removed from the battlefield and her Shadow Queen model is set up on the spot where she was standing before her transformation. Morathi’s Shadow Queen model can only be set up within 3\" of an enemy unit if her High Oracle of Khaine model was within 3\" of that unit before her transformation. If there is insufficient room to place Morathi exactly where she was standing before her transformation, simply place the model as close as possible to that spot where there is sufficient room. If, after her Shadow Queen model has been set up, Morathi is more than 14\" away from the spot where she was standing before her transformation, she cannot move in the following movement phase.\
\
Any wounds allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form prior to her transformation are carried over to her Shadow Queen form and then doubled. For example, if 3 wounds had been allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form before she transformed, she would be set up in her Shadow Queen form with 6 wounds already allocated to her. \
\
Note that Morathi cannot transform back to her former aspect during the battle – once in her Shadow Queen form, she stays that way for the remainder of the battle.\
\
If Morathi was your general in her High Oracle of Khaine form, she remains your general in her Shadow Queen form but she loses the Worship Through Bloodshed command ability.\

Led by the dread warlord Korghos Khul, conqueror of a thousand empires, these blood-drunk killers have cut a gory swathe across the Realm of Fire, leaving nothing but smoking ruins and the piled skulls of their victims behind. Khul has promised to conquer all of Aqshy in his dark master’s name, and such is his fearful reputation and slaughterous might that the outlandish oath hardly seems impossible. There is precious little in all the Mortal Realms that can hold back the unbridled ferocity of the Goretide’s charge.",

After they have laid waste to their enemies, the magic-engorged beasts return to their constantly morphing Herdstones. There they burn the tomes of knowledge pried from the mangled hands of dead wizards, and regurgitate the energies that they themselves have absorbed. In this way, they transform and taint the ordered magics of the civilised races.",
